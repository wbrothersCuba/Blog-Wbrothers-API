# Blog Wbrothers

  

This RESTful API is generated with Laravel, for a blog. In the file database.sql (MYSQL) are the SQL commands to generate the BD, but may be needed to adapt the file.env and modify the line to your configurations:

  

*env:*

  

DB_CONNECTION=mysql

DB_HOST=127.0.0.1

DB_PORT=3306

DB_DATABASE=api_rest_laravel

DB_USERNAME=root

DB_PASSWORD=null

  

and there is a file named api_rest_laravel.sql with the commands required to restore it.

  

Create MYSQL db

  

The app is configured to work with CORS requests already, so you can make request using postman or testing directly in the frontend app. The API uses JWT for authentication so you must generate a token and put it in the headers of the request.
